# No Google Search Ads

Google Ads are annoying. I typically like to employee ad blockers, but in some settings I prefer not to, typically for web development. 

However, I still don't want google ads, because I spend a lot of time in development googling things. As a solution, I have hacked together a super simple extension to prevent ads from showing up in google.

Please see [FireFox's guide for extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#Trying_it_out) for testing this.
