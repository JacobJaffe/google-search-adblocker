# Google Search Adblocker

Google Ads are annoying. I typically like to employee ad blockers, but in some settings I prefer not to, e.g. when doing web development, when I want a clean browser.

However, I still don't want google ads, because I spend a lot of time in development googling things. As a solution, I have hacked together a super simple extension to prevent ads from showing up in google.
